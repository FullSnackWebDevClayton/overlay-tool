# Image Overlay Tool

## Introduction
The Image Overlay Tool is a simple GUI application built with wxPython. It allows users to apply a PNG overlay to a batch of images automatically. This tool is especially useful for photographers, graphic designers, and digital artists who need to apply a consistent overlay or watermark to multiple images at once.

## Features
- Batch processing of images to apply an overlay.
- User-friendly interface to select source and output directories, and the overlay file.
- Supports `.jpg` and `.png` image formats.
- Automatic handling of image orientation based on EXIF data.

The application window will open on double click. Follow these steps to use the tool:
1. Click on the 'Source Folder' button to select the directory containing the images you want to process.
2. Click on the 'Output Folder' button to select the directory where the processed images will be saved.
3. Click on the 'Overlay File' button to select the PNG image that you want to use as an overlay.
4. Click the 'Go' button to start processing the images. A message box will appear once all images have been processed.
